#+TITLE: omnifocus-graph-creator

This is a work in progress project I have. The goal is to be able to
make graphs based on the number of tasks I have completed in omnifocus
overtime.

* Example

* Installing

You can install with [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh:
brew install jakevossen5/taps/omnifocus-graph-creator
#+END_SRC

* Usage

** Getting the Omnifocus CSV

This utility currently depends on a manual CSV export. Here are the
steps to get that

1. Open Omnifocus
2. Go to projects
3. Click on the eye, and select "Show All"
4. Select all of the projects on the left
5. File -> Export -> Select Comma Separated Values (CSV) at the bottom

Then run =omnifocus-graph-creator= in the directory you exported the
CSV to, or specify =--path-to-csv= to specify where the file is manually.

** Full arguments

You can add more arguments to specify the details of the output. For
details, run =omnifocus-graph-creator --help=.

#+BEGIN_SRC:
$ omnifocus-graph-creator --help
