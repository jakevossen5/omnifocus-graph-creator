#+TITLE: omnifocus-graph-creator

This project was used to take a csv output from Omnifocus and give you
information about the history of the tasks you have completed. I got a
ways into rewriting it in Rust, then the OmniGroup came out with
[[https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/using-omnifocus-3.4-with-shortcuts][Siri shortcut get items support]], so I am going to create a similar
program as a Siri shortcut, which should be more elegant than CSV
exporting and a bunch of weird date math.

* Old README
Command line utility that lets you analyze the number of tasks you
have completed in [[https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus][Omnifocus]] over time.

** Example

[[example.png]]

** Installing

You can install with [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh:
brew install jakevossen5/taps/omnifocus-graph-creator
#+END_SRC

** Usage

** Getting the Omnifocus CSV

This utility currently depends on a manual CSV export. Here are the
steps to get that

1. Open Omnifocus
2. Go to projects
3. Click on the eye, and select "Show All"
4. Select all of the projects on the left
5. File -> Export -> Select Comma Separated Values (CSV) at the bottom

Then run =omnifocus-graph-creator= in the directory you exported the
CSV to, or specify =--path-to-csv= to specify where the file is manually.

** Full arguments

You can add more arguments to specify the details of the output. For
details, run =omnifocus-graph-creator --help=.

#+BEGIN_SRC:
$ omnifocus-graph-creator --help
usage: omnifocus-graph-creator [-h] [-p PATH_TO_CSV] [-d DAYS] [-g GOAL] [-e EXPORT_PATH]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATH_TO_CSV, --path-to-csv PATH_TO_CSV
                        path to your OmniFocus CSV export default is
                        'OmniFocus.csv'
  -d DAYS, --days DAYS  the number of days you want to view. Default is 7
  -g GOAL, --goal GOAL  goal number of tasks for each day. Draws horizontal
                        line on graph
  -e EXPORT_PATH, --export-path EXPORT_PATH
                        path of the png output graph (with file extension).
                        Default is None (just show graph).
